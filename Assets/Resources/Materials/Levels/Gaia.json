"levelinfo":" 	Far from the lands of war, death and suffering an old forest stands, energetic and wise. 
		Spreading vastly over miles of land, It is no ordinary place. Blessed by the god of nature, 
		trees tower over a 100 meters above the rich forest including a variety of wild and plantlife. 
		Her influence on this forest cause the big majestic trees to block out the sun causing cold and moist grounds. 
		They provide a constant layer of fog just above the lower tree level. "
